The country has a low cost high speed transportation system called ley lines which allows people to travel to almost anywhere and get back home for dinner. while a less globalised and more partitions version of and network communication system exists, social media does not exist and people spends most of their time exploring the physical worlds and augmented reality worlds rather than the virtual world. Despite the lack of social media and other analogs, people are just as susceptible to creating their own realities which contradicts the real world. It's not augmented reality that confuses people because everyone can clearly tell what's augmented and what's not such as augmented objects have a different sense and feel and look to them, but is the facts that people don't want to believe facts which make them uncomfortable along with a myriad of other forms of thinking that are detrimental to solving problems that benefit everyone.

It's forbidden to use augmented reality recklessly. while using the noosphere to look at memes is not forbidden, fake  advantage of realityis heavily forbidden ands you can't access it anyways because the guardians block  their frequencies  and only allow people to host frequencies of fake augmented reality layers within private establishment that make it clear that they only allow you to be in this layer Wen in disestablishment. so you can't just make yourself look like I Pirates using augmented reality and you can't have everyone else look like Pirates to yourself because the guardians block this from happening. however if there is a 2 way consensus in which both parties agree to be in the same layer then they can be because this is considered a miniature private arena. now within privas tablissements you can have everyone look like they have no face for instance if your layer is programs such that anyone tuned inside at layer will see this. establishments reinforce everyone being on the same layer day dictates because there is a forcefields that is clearly seen in most cases legally that says you must tune into this channel and there's a gentle warning that's you will defaults be tuned into this channel and if you try to tune out guardians will give you a threat and if you do not obey in 3 strikes or do anything threatening then the guardians have the right to detain you using Nets and tazers.

One of the reasons that there's a culture where people talk to each other in public even strangers is because guardians monitor everything and so people are deterred from committing crimes. The reason such a monitoring system existed is because not too long ago there were a lot of crimes involving kids being attacked in public and because the high speed low cost transportation cannot with just 2 importance to be dismantled and people couldn't control their kids people preferred protection with the guardians.
