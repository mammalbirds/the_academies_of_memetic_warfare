The philosophy of the intuition school is that although the logic school it's able to discern facts using reasoning, it's method how to get to those facts is 2 restricted and so creative ways of thinking about the problem in a different way are not promoted. The intuition School believes that in order to get two different perspectives in the first place you need to be able to look at situation from different points of view using individual forms of observation and interpretation. Without these different perspectives, the logic school would have an narrow pool of candidates to listen to as a judge.
