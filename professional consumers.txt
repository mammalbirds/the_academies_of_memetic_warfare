In this fictional world there is a job where people are paid to be consumers. Now how this works is that a content creator will pay a professional consumer to watch their stuff whether it's arts or a video . And professional consumer if they like the stuff will propagate it to their followers. Their followers are people who are like them, so they're not always popular people, they're just people who found that have similar interest, similar to a YouTube recommendation. If their followers also like the recommended  stuff, then the professional consumers will gain a better reputation. The professional creator is paid through donations and other traditional means.
