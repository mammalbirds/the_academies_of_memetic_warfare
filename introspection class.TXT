These techniques cannot be applied to real life as they are only applied to analyzing these fictional memes. However they do borrow concepts similar to those of real academic fields but they misuse them just like how a Sci-Fi novel can misuse the concepts of Consciousness or quantum physics. This is because the purpose is not for realism but for imagination that I find entertaining.

A fact is only a fact under a system of assumptions. There are no inherent facts. Only by assuming that the source the fact comes from is valid can something be considered a fact. For instance, it can be said that what you see is a valid source. Or that a specific reporter from a news agency is a valid source. Determining whether something is valid also depends on underlying assumptions. And so you must check what your assumptions are for each argument until you get to a foundational level. Usually this foundational level is a video or first person Observer or a statement that various sources with the various agendas all agree upon.

People can only agree that something is true when they agree upon the assumptions. If they say that some source is true then you can use the source they believe in to prove a statement they disagree with. People can deny the validity of a statement proved under agreed upon assumptions forever if they have nothing to lose because they see no benefit in saying that statement they disagree with is true, but there are certain breaking points where they must decide to either deny the validity or to suffer the consequences of being wrong under those assumptions. Do they fear putting an innocent person to death? If they do not then they would not change. Then it becomes a different matter where do you must question their own morals. But some people do fear this yet they just have thoughts that are disorganized at the moment and prevent them from seeing different perspectives

Deciding ethics is another issue that is a focus of this class. Before that can be done in depth however, epistemology is required to understand why an individual can personally believe in the validity of statements. It is the foundation of all reasoning in belief. One must question their own reason for believing things as if the referee or microscope is faulty then judgements will also be faulty. Questioning assumptions allows one to understand New Perspectives. For example, if you don't trust someone because everyone says they are a liar, there may be some things that they say which are true that you deny because they're superficially similar the things they said before which sound crazy and were proven to be wrong. But what if when you assume what they say is true can be used to prove many other statements and it's the only model so far which checks out? Doesn't it merit some consideration? Though unlikely, there may be great benefit of considering the possibility of different models under different intuitive measures of uncertainty. But without allowing this possibility, one cannot analyze this model that may be true and thus may never find the truth if the model is the truth under the most foundational assumptions that everyone agrees with such as observation or knowledge that many sources with different agendas all agree upon.

<<<
Questioning assumptions is supposed to lead someone to figure out what moral axioms they want to prioritize. For instance, if you believe someone is a murderer that could have no consequence on you so you're free to accuse whatever without regarding the facts. Now the school can't make someone think a certain way but it can make them see things in a different way and at least this gives a student more options than just to be controlled by the memes. You can't change someone who inherently just wants to harm others without regards to fairness. But if someone doesn't want to harm others yet something inside it's against that then they'll be morally conflicted, and these people can benefit finding the facts because there is possibility that they will change. 

Teaching someone the tools of reasoning and identifying uncertainty is easier then getting an individual to be more aware of their own psychology. Trying to identify the causes of One's Own thoughts it's not easy and can lead to asserting the wrong causes both when someone does it to an individual and when the individual does it to them self. So forget about finding the causes and trying to cure the causes; all that matters it's trying to find the facts to stop the murders. It doesn't matter what others think all that matters is you personally getting the right facts; of course convincing someone is importance if they can do something to you which is negative. Else the focus is on actual consequences rather than things such as road rage. Prioritize even during anger; this is hard to teach and requires a lot of introspection and experience and years for some people because everyone is different. The least the school can do is give people tools and Hammer in messages into subconsciousness that can steer them in the right direction to deal with these things throughout their entire life not just during school.

Let go of the why and move on. It's not about why you have to bias; just don't have the bias. Some think that you have to address the cause the cure it. But maybe a different model is needed as an analogy. Instead of thinking that the cause will always return maybe it was a one-time cause. You can't stop a car crash that already happened and so the goal is just to rehabilitate. Or maybe it's none of these models because psychologically it's much different than anything else. Maybe it's best to just ignore it. When angry about people who look down on you, does it help to believe that you are this way because of some childhood issues? It depends on the case probably. The goal right now is to focus on getting the facts not about getting back at others. Sometimes there's more than one right answer. So one answer may be to not care about the cause because maybe it really doesn't help plus you'll probably not find the right cause; it's just to say focus on the consequence and the mind will self-organize just like the immune system to find a new way of thinking.

It's hard to teach desires such as compassion for others but it may be possible for people who already have it to self-reflect and find it within themselves when they are conflicted with many complicated thoughts. The main goal is not to introduce fundamental emotions that may be built by experience schools cannot offer or our inherent to an individual, but to get people to organize their thoughts so they can realize things that part of them want but don't realize other parts of them are keeping away perhaps by trickery or ignorance.

Admit uncertainty and quantify it using intuition just like- for one container with a liter of water and another with a milliliter of water- you can quantify which container has more water in its just by looking at it without measuring it.

Facing Danger can make people be more cautious but it can also make them be more irrational under pressure. Each person deals with things differently for different situations with different factors, sometimes unpredictably. There is no one right answer. Each individual must find what works for them and allow change if it doesn't work anymore. The school cannot deal with each individual so all it can do is allow them to learn different tools so they can use them situationally. It is not preachy; it aims to Simply introduce New Perspectives that people may not encounter outside of a controlled learning environment due to the chaos of life. It makes students aware of dangers while being in a safe calm environment.

The school requires students to use proof and logic to justify statements. This means many statements will have different degrees of uncertainty and always at least some uncertainty. So students are tots to be comfortable under uncertainty. The intuition School criticizes this as it believes that belief is key to driving novelty and problem solving and that too much uncertainty even if it's Justified logically will hold back imagination. logic school thinks imagination still exists under uncertainty because people can think hypothetically and it can also Imagine fictional stories without believing in them. Another criticism of the logic School is that its methods of introspection erode individuality, and cause overthinking. They claim the school thinks there's only one way to think about things when in actuality the subconscious mind can pick up on things that reasoning cannot.

Recognize story Beats and don't be tricked by them; the class teaches that just because the narrative sounds right and you've bonded with the good guy doesn't mean that's always the case that theyre right. Identifying this from a third person if propaganda is pretty easy because everyone tells its propaganda. But from a first person point of view it can be difficult because emotionally one may not want to admit because for instance it has the implications that one is wrong and it's someone who is clearly a jerk and has done many wrong things is right in that instance. But can't go the other way around and say just because it sounds good that means it's wrong. It means this should not be a decisive factor and that it should always be questioned; look at other factors such as the contents in which can you prove the statements using logic under certain assumptions.

There are no grades in certain cases; the consequence of what one does in assignment will be recorded and that will be one's grades that they can self-reflect on to get better throughout their entire life.

All of these have pros and cons the school may have a negative effect; the author merely records and the reader is the one who interprets and judges.
