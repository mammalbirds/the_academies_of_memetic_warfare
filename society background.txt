Ever since religion was overthrown in the last centuries, the people have trusted science to provide them with technologies that help them I can see outside threat and other issues. The worlds of the Sahara and country is pretty connected and most of its residents want to get along. However, there have been many disagreements among scientists over the right way to interpret theories answer manage the country. This has caused varying groups dis idref different groups of scientists, who are the most trusted authorities in the country. Each partitions network controls a different set of communication channels and meme  trading channelsthat people listen to casually no they don't need to swear allegiance to because society is mostly peaceful due to the lack of violence with the guardians supervising the public in with the culture encouraging people too not engage inter warfare but not discouraging verbal violence.

Politics does not play of major role in the story but is in the background and indirectly influences peoples ways of perceiving themselves and others. although  religionis not practiced by 99% of people, there are many splintered belief groups based on the scientific fiore    they choose  Ah scribe  to. Among these many groups there are 6 that play prominent roles in society. The 2 main political parties are D protectionists ANS the anti  segregationists. The protection is believe that the natural world should be preserved and we should use technology to serve in this protection rather than 2 create new parts of nature. Did anti segregation is believe that deprotection is are part of an out dated oppression system that served 2 trick communities into staying where they belong so to speak well those who have power sailfin from them.

There are many issues and among them include these four. One of them is a huge amount of people in the working class. The protectionist party believes that the working class should not be tricks bye the industrialist technocratic culture of the anti-segregation party. They believe that the homogeneous culture that the anti-segregation aR producing is 1 of materialistic greed and that the working class should focus on resisting and overthrowing this harmful ideology. They seek to Foster a culture where the working class comes to you to be against the Elites in society. I believe that focusing on things such as raising minimum wage is only going to create a competitive Cut Throat culture where those within the same class will be pitted against one another the wages are increased in this story Society it will be less jobs due to businesses not being able to hire more people.

The anti-segregation party believe that the protection is party is mislead the working class and trying to keep them down. They say that the working-class should have all the freedoms to join this new Advanced Society encourages A diversity a people to succeed. It believes that in the past deletes were the one trying to keep down to working class by preventing them from Gaining wealth and power in society which is required to make decisions. They don't agree that modern Society should be something to be ashamed about. Thus they believe in raising the minimum wage for instance.

Another issue that these two parties face is dealing with environments. Both parties believe in the law of natural selection that it's not a law to be questions but how nature is supposed to work, and that to go against the scientific law is to be unscientific. They differ and how it interprets this proposed law. The anti-segregation believe that in the past natural selection was prevented from occurring because the oppressive power structures a society try to separate people and trick them into thinking that they had to preserve their original culture when in actuality all this did what's prevent them from realizing that there's a modern ization of their culture. They believe that all people deserve to live in a society that is pro science and I barriers from keeping cultures from naturally modernizing is a form of hierarchical oppression. They believe that the environment and animals within its are only temporary and that all of the environment must be changed to form a United harmonious society. Therefore any attempts to try to preserve the environments are unnatural and will only serve to prevent all of nature from joining in a scientifically Advanced Society. They do not seek to save environments or its species that currently exist but two figure out how to integrate it's into society by doing things such as changing carnivores into herbivores to reduce death.

T protectionists believe that nature must be preserved because by the law of natural selection and contact division of labor each segment of society must help each other with its own unique advantages and a natural Co-op to protect and Preserve is what nature wants. They believe that if everything is integrated into technocratic culture then living beings will suffer because this culture is harmful and only serves as a necessary means just like how Executioner's and vultures serving necessary but ugly role in nature. Thus they believed that technology exists to serve nature which might be different from what it was a million years ago but it is our nature and so we must protect our nature then see it fail like it did a million years ago. They don't believe the change was a success they believe that it was a failure. It failed because it did not have the system of cooperation.

The next issue about these groups is that there is a minority group and as Society which came from a culture that did not believe in hierarchical structures and in money. This culture originating on islands close to the main country contains a community of people who lived in small commute and had a more youthful appearance then other communities. They were focused on fostering curiosity and inventiveness and Imagination but they hated and did not trust any scientific work from an industry or higher authority. This peaceful Society when integrated into the main modern societies suffered from distrust and a culture Clash. Many people did not believe that these diaspora could adapt to a culture of money and Industrial science and technological advancements, believing that they were into a collective mind sets a smaller communes in which everyone can trust each other. This prevented the main communities from integrating these minorities and us and therefore these minorities faced ridicule and a lack of opportunity. Additionally, their distrust of all authority that did not have a face made them skeptical Of Inventions should such as vaccines and cures for diseases. So when a huge pandemic threatened the worlds and everyone is vaccinated this minority group suffered greatly as they rejected the vaccinations.

The anti segregationists believe that unfair stereotype of this Bohemian minority group cause people to keep them down. They cite that ever since the Bohemian group migrated into modern-day they quickly modernized and a modernization that was a mix of their communal culture with an industrial technocratic culture was ready to allow the group to share in the power and wealth of society. However, the existing communities did not allow them in due to wrong perceptions and hatred and fear. Therefore to help this minority group laws must be implemented that encourage them to integrate; if these laws did not exist then people would befree to spread false information that they cannot integrate.

The protectionist believe that the Bohemian group culture is one of the most beautiful on Earth and must be preserved. A claim that the anti-segregation are trying to destroy this culture by discouraging bohemian groups 2 preserve their way of life. They mention evidence that shows the modernization of Bohemian culture destroys the peaceful and hierarchy void society and encourages a destructive lifestyle at the technocratic culture. They wants to implement laws that show just how destructive technocratic culture is.

In addition to their beliefs about the law of natural selection, the two groups have roped in another conflicts which is largely unrelated to the other issues but which by the power of confusing the map for the territory and bad associations, they have led people to believe are extremely related. This conflicts is the Divide or the artificial dichotomy between experimental and a theorists. After much conflicts within the scientific communities, now that the scientist games a lot of power over Society due to their large influence as people turn to them for answers and Leadership, divide in science began to occur 4 people settle personal disputes rather than to actually find what works and doesn't work. Among the many groups two main groups emerged in which the experimental it's believe that they can only rely on data generalize from experiments and a theorists believe they can can only rely on series strongly proven from mimetic modeling. The experimentalists claim that they are rooted in reality and US nature wild theorists are no better than people who believe in religion. The theorists believe that they are the ones who can build a future that improves upon the mistakes of nature and the experimentalists will not be able to come up with Solutions that plan for a revolutionary improved Society which is what is needed. The protectionist have trick people into you falsely associating experimentalists with their other causes and anti-segregation have done the same for the theorists. This creates a duopoly a people's beliefs.
