[working title] MEME: Book I- The Academies of Memetic Warfare
OR, mem[e-acute] -- to distinguish from [meem] pronounce. meh-may. Only reasons is because it sounds and looks interesting like something from a magic book, And strange how Pokemon uses it 

The background  of the story is that there have been many murders going around and people don't know what's happening. In order to stop the murders, people have been turning to the scientist they trust from their group their belief group and using what they say to try to find out who the murderer's are, in which they justifications are done using scientific models many of which which are the memes. Because memes are up to each person's interpretation people don't always interpret memes to find the correct pattern that I'm sure what's actually going on behind the murder, so the memes make the people susceptible to being controlled by other people who who want to collect the strongest means to control other peoples minds.

The setting of the story is an alternative history where homo sapiens already existed but evolved differently and didn't evolve into any of the communities and cultures that we had in our history or have today, so not a single one resembles a single culture does existed in our knowledge of human history. The country is set in the Sahara at the time where the Sahara is a rainforest.

The story follows several characters from different points of view including a survivalist, an inventor, a group of students, and a group of teachers.

The story structure is as follows in which the beginning is pretty long and describes a one sided perspective to the reader despite following multiple characters from different points of view that serves as an introduction to this alternative world. The second part of the story is where the 2 academies discuss how to resist control from the memes although they don't say this directly they just say how to train students to make better decisions because many believe they don't know and are ill equipped to deal with many issues such as the murders and conflicts in disputes of daily life. The third parts is where the  students begin to rebel against academies and's the story beats and narratives become confusing it with you don't know what is rights because there's all this information that's contradicting each other and 1 or few consistent narratives emerge you can't tell if there right just by how they feel because content wise there's many factors determine whether they are based on correct information and even if consistent morality.

While there are statements in this book that are based on reality, such as the research classes and problem-solving class being based on real techniques, many statements in this book are based on Fiction and should not be applied to real life. For instance, the introspection techniques used to deal with memes are based on fictional psychological and physics principles that these written characters interact with and cannot be applied to real life. Since they deal with memetic objects that are fictional, they are as real as spells in a fantasy novel.
